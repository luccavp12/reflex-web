# Theme Panel

The `ThemePanel` component is a container for the `Theme` component. It provides a way to change the theme of the application.

```python
rx.theme_panel()
```

The theme panel is closed by default. You can set it open `default_open=True`.

```python
rx.theme_panel(default_open=True)
```
